Number of trackers:
/NrOfTrackers: Number of trackers, usually 1 for all common MPPTs, and 2 or 4 for MPPT RS.

PV Array voltages and currents:
/Pv/V             <- PV array voltage, path exists only for single tracker product (all common MPPTs)
/Pv/0/V           <- PV array voltage from 1st tracker
/Pv/x/V           <- PV array voltage from tracker x+1; today's max number of trackers in a single Victron product is 4.
/Pv/0/P           <- PV array power (Watts) from 1st tracker
/Pv/x/P           <- PV array power from tracker no. x+1.
/Yield/Power      <- Total PV power (Watts).

  Two examples:
  1) a solar charger with one tracker has 2 paths:
  /Pv/V
  /Yield/Power

  2) a solar charger with two trackers has 5 paths:
  /Pv/0/V
  /Pv/0/P
  /Pv/1/V
  /Pv/1/P
  /Yield Power

  deprecated per v2.80:
  /Pv/I             <- PV current (= /Yield/Power divided by /Pv/V)
  /Pv/x/I

External control:
/Link/NetworkMode     <- Bitmask
                      0x1 = External control
                      0x4 = External voltage/current control
                      0x8 = Controled by BMS (causes Error #67, BMS lost, if external control is interrupted).
/Link/BatteryCurrent <- When SCS is enabled on the GX device, the battery current is written here to improve tail-current detection.
/Link/ChargeCurrent  <- Maximum charge current. Must be written every 60 seconds. Used by GX device if there is a BMS or user limit.
/Link/ChargeVoltage  <- Charge voltage. Must be written every 60 seconds. Used by GX device to communicate BMS charge voltages.
/Link/NetworkStatus  <- Bitmask
                     0x01 = Slave
                     0x02 = Master
                     0x04 = Standalone
                     0x20 = Using I-sense (/Link/BatteryCurrent)
                     0x40 = Using T-sense (/Link/TemperatureSense)
                     0x80 = Using V-sense (/Link/VoltageSense)
/Link/TemperatureSense       <- When STS is enabled, the GX device will write the battery temperature here
/Link/TemperatureSenseActive <- Indicate when temperature sense is in use
/Link/VoltageSense           <- When SVS is active, the GX device will write the battery voltage here
/Link/VoltageSenseActive     <- INdicate when voltage sense is in use

Settings:
/Settings/BmsPresent         <- BMS in the system. External control is expected.
                                This happens automatically if NetworkMode is set to expect a BMS.
/Settings/ChargeCurrentLimit <- The maximum configured (non-volatile) charge current. This is the same as set by VictronConnect.

/Relay/0/State    <- Read to see the state of the relay in the Battery Monitor. In case configured
                     to the "Remote" mode, using the VictronConnect App [SEE NOTE], the relay can be controlled
                     by writing to this path.

                     NOTE: currently, 2022-08-17, VictronConnect does not yet offer that settings. It is
                     planned for later in 2022. Until then, the relay control in the MPPT cannot be set to this mode by
                     any available ready to use Victron software.
